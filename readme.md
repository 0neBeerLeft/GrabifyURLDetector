# Grabify URL Detector Website

This is a website project that allows you to check if a given URL is a Grabify URL, which is a type of URL that is used to steal user information and IP addresses. The website is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How it Works

The website works by taking a user-inputted URL and analyzing it to determine if it is a Grabify URL. It does this by checking if the URL contains any of the known Grabify domains or IP addresses.

If the URL is determined to be a Grabify URL, the website will display a warning message to the user informing them of the potential security risk. If the URL is not a Grabify URL, the website will display a message indicating that the URL is safe to visit.

The detection algorithm used in this website is based on a list of known Grabify domains. This list is regularly updated to ensure the website remains effective at detecting Grabify URLs.

## Usage

To use the Grabify URL Detector, simply go to the website and enter the URL you want to check in the input field provided. Then click on the "Check" button. The website will display a message indicating whether the URL is a Grabify URL or not.
