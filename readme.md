# Grabify URL Detector Website

This is a website project that allows you to check if a given URL is a Grabify URL, which is a type of URL used to steal user information and IP addresses. The website is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Why I Made This Tool

It is common for people on Discord and the web to send IP logger links to others in order to take down their internet or threaten them with DDoS attacks. I created this tool to help people easily identify if a link is an IP logger, providing a simple way to stay safe online.

## How it Works

The website analyzes user-inputted URLs to determine if they match known Grabify domains or IP addresses. It does this by checking against an updated list of Grabify domains.

- If the URL is identified as a Grabify URL, a warning message is displayed to inform the user of the potential security risk.
- If the URL is not a Grabify URL, the website will display a message indicating that the URL appears to be safe.

The detection algorithm relies on a maintained list of known Grabify domains, ensuring effective and up-to-date detection.

## Usage

1. Go to the website.
2. Enter the URL you want to check in the input field.
3. Click on the "Check" button.
4. The website will indicate whether the URL is a Grabify URL or not.
